to apply annotations to an animation use hkanno: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54244
hkanno tutorial by Distar: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFwW9dVUZiE

annotations don't work with FNIS, if you want to use them you have to create a Nemesis patch
Nemesis patch tool: https://github.com/VersuchDrei/AnimlistTransitionTool/releases/tag/1.1

OStim registers a bunch of annotations in its Nemesis patch, some of them take parameters in the payload, others are just a simple annotation
list of annotations that OStim is reacting to:

--- OStimClimax ---
causes the actor to climax, should be used in combination with climax auto transitions
syntax: OStimClimax

--- OStimEvent ---
causes an event to fire (see events README)
syntax: OStimEvent.[event],[target]   or
		OStimEvent.[event],[actor],[target],[performer]
examples: OStimEvent.spank,1 - the actor playing the animation has spanked the actor at index 1
		  OStimEvent.spank,0,1,0 - the actor at index 0 has spanked the actor at index 1

--- OStimUndress ---
removes all of the actors clothes
syntax: OStimRedress

--- OStimRedress ---
redresses all previously undressed clothes on the actor
syntax: OStimRedress

--- OStimUndressPartial ---
removes all of the actors clothes that match the slot mask, slot masks have to be given in hexadecimal notation
for slot mask values refer to: https://www.creationkit.com/index.php?title=Slot_Masks_-_Armor
syntax: OStmUndressPartial.[slotmask]
examples: OStimUndressPartial.0x1 - removes the actors helmet
		  OStimUndressPartial.0x60 - removes the actors amulet and ring

--- OStimRedressPartial ---
redresses all previously undressed clothes on the actor that match the slot mask, slot masks have to be given in hexadecimal notation
for slot mask values refer to: https://www.creationkit.com/index.php?title=Slot_Masks_-_Armor
syntax: OStmRedressPartial.[slotmask]
examples: OStimRedressPartial.0x1 - redresses the actors helmet
		  OStimRedressPartial.0x60 - redresses the actors amulet and ring

--- OStimRemoveWeapons ---
removes the actors weapons
syntax: OStimRemoveWeapons

--- OStimAddWeapons ---
adds previously removed weapons back to the actor
syntax: OStimAddWeapons

--- OStimEquipObject ---

syntax: OStimEquipObject.[type]
examples: OStimEquipObject.strapon - equips a strap on
		  OStimEquipObject.tongue - adds a tongue to the actor

--- OStimUnequipObject ---
removes an equip object from the actor (see equip objects README)syntax: OStimEquipObject.[type]
examples: OStimUnequipObject.strapon - unequips the strap on
		  OStimUnequipObject.tongue - removes the tongue to the actor

--- OStimSetLooking ---
sets the facial modifiers of the eyeballs (for right or down use negative values in the left or up fields)
syntax: OStimSetLooking.[lookLeft]   or
		OStimSetLooking.[lookLeft],[lookUp]
examples: OStimSetLooking.-100 - makes the actor look to the right
		  OStimSetLooking.25,25 - makes the actor look slightly left up

--- OStimUnsetLooking ---
removes the facial modifiers of the eyeballs, making actors look straight ahead
syntax: OStimUnsetLooking

--- OStimResetLooking ---
resets the facial modifiers to what was defined in the scene file (see scenes README)
if the scene file has no looking direction defined this has the same effect as OStimUnsetLooking
syntax: OStimResetLooking

--- OStimPlayExpression ---
makes the actor play the expression event (see facial expressions README)
syntax: OStimPlayExpression.[expression]
example: OStimPlayExpression.moan - causes the actor to make a moan expression (but not a moan sound)

--- OStimBendSoS ---
bends the schlong relatively to the value defined in the scene file (see scenes README)
syntax: OStimBendSoS.[angle]
examples: OStimBendSoS.2 - causes the schlongs angle to increase by 2, if it is set to 3 in the scene file it will now go to 5
		  OStimBendSoS.-3 - causes the schlongs angle to reduce by -3

--- OStimResetSoS ---
resets the schlong angle to the value defined in the scene file (see scenes README)
syntax: OStimResetSoS

--- OStimPeak ---
